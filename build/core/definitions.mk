## Custom Build System Definitons
## Called from build/core/definitions.mk
## Use this file to 
## 1. Add additonal global helper functions 
## 2. Override existing functions defined by definitions.mk
##

## Stash the old expand-required-modules recipe before
## defining a new one.
define expand-required-modules-old=$(value expand-required-modules)
endef

## The new expand-required-modules filters out any
## Packages defined by PRODUCT_PACKAGES_FILTER
define expand-required-modules
$(call expand-required-modules-old,$(1),$(2))\
$(eval $(1) := $(filter-out $(PRODUCT_PACKAGES_FILTER),$($(1))))
endef

## Override MKBOOTIMG with a custom one if configured 
## This is a bit of a hack but we get away with it as 
## definitions.mk is included after config.mk where this
## is originally defined
ifneq (,$(strip $(BOARD_CUSTOM_MKBOOTIMG)))
MKBOOTIMG := $(BOARD_CUSTOM_MKBOOTIMG)
$(info "MKBOOTIMG $(MKBOOTIMG)")
