2. http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html 
3. wget https://raw.github.com/trevd/android_vendor_archos/master/vendorinit.sh
4. sudo chmod 755 vendorinit.sh
5. source vendorinit.sh

vendor/archos
=============

This is base camp for building the AOSP for the Archos G9 A80S 


Initializing The AOSP Build Environment for Archos Devices
==========================================================

Complete the steps outlined @
http://source.android.com/source/initializing.html and
http://source.android.com/source/downloading.html 

Before beginning the build process we need to sync the Archos
device tree and hardware repository. 

1. wget https://raw.github.com/trevd/android_vendor_archos/master/vendorinit.sh
2. chmod 755 vendorinit.sh
3. source vendorinit.sh

This will do the following :

Downloads the archos-vendor.xml to local_manifests
Sync the vendor/archos repository the re-run 
source build/envsetup.sh

The build/envsetup.sh locates and executes the contents of any vendorsetup.sh
files it finds.

vendor/archos/vendorsetup.sh
============================

This script takes over the initialization and performs the following actions

1. Applies required patches 

hardware/libhardware - 
Apply Texas Intrustments OMAP4 Framebuffer and Hardware Composer Enhancements 
to hwcomposer.h & fb.h

chromium_org - 
Apply the POWER SGX540_120 gpu driver fix.
Chromium ( blink ) doesn't support older gpus out of the box.
Rendering fails on the webbrowser resulting in Black Rectangles 

frameworks/native
a. Apply Texas Intrustments OMAP4 Framebuffer and Hardware Composer Enhancements
	to the Surfaceflinger 
b. Add Dithering Support from CyanogenMod
c. Fix SGX540_120 Gfx Rotation and Screenshot glitches


2. Download archos-aosp.xml to local_manifests & runs repo sync for the new projects

This contains the rest of the projects required to enable archos hardware support


Building and Running
